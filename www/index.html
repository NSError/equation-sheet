        <p>Are you tired of sucky equation sheets in maths classes? Things that
        are typeset by a monkey on amphetamines during an earthquake? Are you
        tired of the lack of pretty diagrams and useful identities? Perhaps the
        paper it was printed on irritates you?</p>

        <p>Well, have I got the answer for you! It's actually trivial to roll
        your own equation sheet in \(\LaTeX\) - and it's easy to make your own
        diagrams using post-script directives to the \(\LaTeX\) interpreter. But,
        indeed, the extreme levels of tweaking necessary to perfect this would
        be onerous and burdensome!  Rather than waste your extremely valuable
        time, why not start with an intelligent default? Perhaps it's good
        enough that no tweaking is necessary?</p>

        <p>Have I got your attention now?</p>

        <p>Well then

        <a href="https://github.com/downloads/NSError/equation-sheet/eqnsheet-2012.10.30.pdf">download the equation sheet</a>.
        Look it over. You'll like it - especially because with just a handy
        fork you can customise it to your heart's content.</p>

        <h3>Erratta</h3>

        <p>I am well aware that this project hardly qualifies as complete. I'm
        still waiting to take Math 101B and 101C (the rest of calculus). So
        integral identities and formulae are conspicuously missing as of now.
        If you'd like to add them, just make a pull-request. I'm happy to help
        you with any \(\LaTeX\)-fu you may need to get the job done!</p>

        <p>It's also in my list of things to do regarding this project to make
        a better way of generating the diagrams. I think a system using
        ERB/Thor would work beautifully, so you could control the diagram
        detail to a certain extent. The ability to use computed numbers instead
        of hand-computed decimals will make the diagrams look much more
        accurate at high resolutions, as well. Not that anyone would really
        care about that.</p>
